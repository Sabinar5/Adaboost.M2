# Adaboost.M2

This project implements a neural network-based AdaBoost.M2 algorithm to predict student performance using the Student Performance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Project Overview
Dataset: Student academic records with features such as study time, attendance, and past grades.
Objective: Classify students as "Pass" or "Fail" based on their final grade (G3).

Approach:
Neural Network: A fully connected feedforward network trained as a weak learner.
AdaBoost.M2: An ensemble method that boosts multiple neural network models to improve classification performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Finds the best learning rate, epoch count, and network architecture.
